1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis


```r
# load data
data_row <- read.csv('activity.csv')

# remove NA in data
data <- data_row[ with (data_row, { !(is.na(steps)) } ), ]

# print out first 20 rows
head(data,20)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1.Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

2.If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

3.Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day


```r
by_day <- group_by(data, date)
steps_by_day <- summarise(by_day, total = sum(steps))
steps_by_day
```

```
## # A tibble: 53 x 2
##    date       total
##    <fctr>     <int>
##  1 2012-10-02   126
##  2 2012-10-03 11352
##  3 2012-10-04 12116
##  4 2012-10-05 13294
##  5 2012-10-06 15420
##  6 2012-10-07 11015
##  7 2012-10-09 12811
##  8 2012-10-10  9900
##  9 2012-10-11 10304
## 10 2012-10-12 17382
## # ... with 43 more rows
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day


```r
summary(steps_by_day)
```

```
##          date        total      
##  2012-10-02: 1   Min.   :   41  
##  2012-10-03: 1   1st Qu.: 8841  
##  2012-10-04: 1   Median :10765  
##  2012-10-05: 1   Mean   :10766  
##  2012-10-06: 1   3rd Qu.:13294  
##  2012-10-07: 1   Max.   :21194  
##  (Other)   :47
```
Mean of total number of steps per day is 10766, median is 10765.

## Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


```r
hist(steps_by_day$total, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day", xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

What is the average daily activity pattern?
  
  1.Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps     taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
  
  2.Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of          steps?

```r
# preprocessing data for plot
steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

# create a time series plot 
plot(steps_by_interval$interval, steps_by_interval$steps, type='l', 
     main="Average number of steps over all days", xlab="Interval", 
     ylab="Average number of steps")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# find row with max of steps
max_steps_row <- which.max(steps_by_interval$steps)

# find interval with this max
steps_by_interval[max_steps_row, ]
```

```
##     interval    steps
## 104      835 206.1698
```

The interval 835 has the maximum average value of steps (206.1698).

## Imputing missing values


Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

  1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with      NAs)

  2.Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be     sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute           interval, etc.
  
  3.Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

  4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median       total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the       assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?





```r
sum(is.na(data_row))
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

```r
#I picked the strategy of replacing NA's with the mean for that 5-minute interval.

data_imputed <- data_row
for (i in 1:nrow(data_imputed)) {
  if (is.na(data_imputed$steps[i])) {
    interval_value <- data_imputed$interval[i]
    steps_value <- steps_by_interval[
      steps_by_interval$interval == interval_value,]
    data_imputed$steps[i] <- steps_value$steps
  }
}
```

I've created new data set data_no_na which equals to data_row but without NA's. All NA's are replaced with mean of 5-minute interval.


```r
# calculate  total number of steps taken each day
df_imputed_steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data_imputed, sum)
head(df_imputed_steps_by_day)
```

```
##         date    steps
## 1 2012-10-01 10766.19
## 2 2012-10-02   126.00
## 3 2012-10-03 11352.00
## 4 2012-10-04 12116.00
## 5 2012-10-05 13294.00
## 6 2012-10-06 15420.00
```

```r
hist(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps, main="Histogram of total number of steps per day (imputed)",  xlab="Total number of steps in a day")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
# get mean and median of imputed data
mean(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(df_imputed_steps_by_day$steps)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
# get mean and median of data without NA's
mean(steps_by_day$total)
```

```
## [1] 10766.19
```

```r
median(steps_by_day$total)
```

```
## [1] 10765
```

Mean values stays the same but therer is slight difference in meadian value.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

For this part the weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

  1.Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a      given date is a weekday or weekend day.
  
  2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the     average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README        file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data. 


```r
data_imputed['type_of_day'] <- weekdays(as.Date(data_imputed$date))
data_imputed$type_of_day[data_imputed$type_of_day  %in% c('Saturday','Sunday') ] <- "weekend"
data_imputed$type_of_day[data_imputed$type_of_day != "weekend"] <- "weekday"
# convert type_of_day from character to factor
data_imputed$type_of_day <- as.factor(data_imputed$type_of_day)

# calculate average steps by interval across all days
df_imputed_steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + type_of_day, data_imputed, mean)

# creat a plot
qplot(interval, 
      steps, 
      data = df_imputed_steps_by_interval, 
      type = 'l', 
      geom=c("line"),
      xlab = "Interval", 
      ylab = "Number of steps", 
      main = "") +
  facet_wrap(~ type_of_day, ncol = 1)
```

```
